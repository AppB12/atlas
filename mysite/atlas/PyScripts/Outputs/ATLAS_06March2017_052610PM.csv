",,I had this for just over a year. I used it for a couple months. everything was great. Then we were caught in rain and it never worked after that. The manual says it's waterproof but it must be wrong. I noticed that my brother's Bocsh radio had GFCI outlets on his. it would be a great addition to this radio and better whether proofing. I could not recommend this tool to anyone even though I do recommend Milwaukee tools to people. This has been my first disappointment from Milwaukee Tool.,Not the quality someone would expect from Milwaukee,,,Knelezen,,HD

I like the more compact size of this one, and the fact that it still charges batterys is key. Yes the sound could be a little better, looked at the newer flat one that fits in the dewalt rack and it was just too awkward, Lid was hard to open, It probably has a little better sound, but I just like the shape and toughness on this style. Change is cord wraps on the side instead of bottom, I'm on the fence on that. But the preset stations are really nice as I do switch between different stations. so far I have not had an issue with reception.","I've had my dewalt radio for 16 years, and it finally died, switched to the new 20v to match my n...",,,Cyndell,,HD
