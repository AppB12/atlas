",," There really is a lot to like about this tv... About the only thing I do not love is the new style remote.... It is very light weight to the hand... Still too new to know all the in &amp; outs of this model...but it has everything you can get on a tv but 4K. Useful USB port too... You can flash drive music,movies and photos with this port....no one broadcasts or makes much input for us to use 4 K on anyway....yet...found the guide for over the air broadcast, on this tv to be of little use.but the TV GUIDE app has everything...It is on the I pad...VIZIO also has apps....  I have figured out how to cast the I pad and I phone to the big screen on you tube, and that is very very handy...<br> This tv found the router in just a minute...and after you set your zip code and time zone bingo your watching on the Internet or live streaming broadcast, or if your hooked up cable tv... Seems the blue ray picture is supposed to be the best but I am very pleased with over air HDTV and the antenna...<br> I have a VIZIO sound bar but it does NOT fit between the set's legs.... It must have room in front of them, or under them even better... But together these two units will blow you away...yet keep you in budget really<br> This is an up grade from a VIZIO 37 inch from a few years back...another great tv...<br>But this one is almost huge in the room...remember there bigger when you get them home....",There really is a lot to like about this tv...
