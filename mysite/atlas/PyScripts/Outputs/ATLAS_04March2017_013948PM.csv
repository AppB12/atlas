",," I bought this as a brand-new unit and had it delivered but not installed. When I went to roll it into place a screw on the underside that was installed at the wrong angle and not completely tightened down scratched up my floors. Upon further inspection my ""brand new"" unit had dents on the top, the top two fridge door bracket screw holes were stripped and had helicoils installed(badly) to try and fix them, then the new screw was cross-threaded into the helicoil. So either Frigidaire or Home Depot sold me a damaged, badly-repaired fridge as new. I've now lost a half-day of work getting their tech to come out and confirm the defects. I'll lose another half-day getting this thing picked up. And I'm having to go through Frigidaire's claim department to get my damaged floor fixed.","Multiple defects, clearly a repaired fridge sold as new, it caused damage to my house",,,Pixel,,HD
