","I find this to be a good value at the price. It is not in the Dr. Beats or Bose category, but much better than average in the second tier. I thought I had a defective pair before I realized that there is a touch pad for the volume on the earpiece and in was in the mute position. Noise canceling is good.","I find this to be a good value at the price. It is not in the Dr. Beats or Bose category, but mu...",EyeDoc,HD

","When I was looking at upgrading the existing Samsung HD Television for my bedroom, Bluetooth was a must! When I found this great headset I was sold on features, brand, and overall value! I am a night owl and watch TV well after my wife goes to bed. It literally takes less than 30 seconds to
Power on my headphones and press the select button when the Headphone Option appears! I set the sleep timer on the Television, and I sleep with these on all night with out any snoring to wake me! The noise canceling really works well!,, thank you for such a great product!!!!!",Bought these Headphones for my new Samsung 4K UHD TV,RickWRN,HD
