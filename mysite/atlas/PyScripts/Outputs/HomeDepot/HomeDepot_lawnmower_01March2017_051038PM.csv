"," I have never left a review before but this is simply the best mower I have ever used. I have had it for about a year and not a single problem but I would expect that for any mower. What makes this mower extraordinary is it's auto choke easy start engine, intuitive easy to use drive system and it's light weight maneuverability. But the best feature is it's twin cutting blades. They do such a good job of mulching that I have only used the bag once. The mulch never clumps, never bogs down the mower and is virtually invisible no matter the grass length or how wet. This mower is so good that I plan on buying for my son for a house warming gift. I highly recommend this model, no need to go any higher in price!",I have never left a review before but this is simply the best mower I have ever used. I have had ...,ManuelLabor,HD

"," The mower made it's maiden voyage today, and performed flawlessly. Assembled easily in minutes, and cranked on the first pull. My bermuda lawn gets scalped once early each year, so I set the mower to its lowest setting. Adding to the challenge is the fact that my lawn is covered with last years leaves. I started in bag mode, but quickly re-evaluated after filling the bag with leaves in one pass. Switching to mulch mode, countless trips to empty the bag were avoided. My old mower is a Honda, so I expected quality performance. Still, I was pleasantly surprised at the results in mulch mode. Granted, I needed double passes on occasion to completely mulch the leaves, but double passes were much quicker than continually dumping the bag, and the motor never stalled.  I was skeptical about the variable speed control, especially after reading the 1* reviews. Once again, pleasantly surprised! It took some experimentation to get the adjustable paddles in a desirable position, which for me was rather low, so that no matter how far I depressed them, the speed never got very high. Many with poor reviews cited speed control and thumb fatigue as issues. My instinct was to lay my thumbs on the paddles too, but Honda's promo video shows that the proper grip has the pad of the thumb knuckle laying on the paddles, with thumbs either above, or wrapped under the grip. In this manner, rolling the wrist slightly toggles the mechanism, rather than using thumb leverage. (Honda's promo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5ikBT_DOkE ). It was easy to control acceleration and no hand cramps at all. Mower started cold, started hot and the transition of the auto choke was undetectable. A flawless performance today, and I expect years of the same. Pros: easy start, flawless auto choke, no stalls, good mulch quality<br>Cons: bag is a bit smaller than the previous model. Could be problematic with very high/thick grass, but shouldn't be a problem for once-a-week mowers. I recommend mulch mode for high grass.","The mower made it's maiden voyage today, and performed flawlessly. Assembled easily in minutes, a...",davhen,HD

"," I am a teen who own my own lawn service, so I have had to venture out and buy various types of lawn equipment. In doing so, I have discovered many things about all the big name brands and their quality. My dad owns the 2011 model of this mower, and has had wonderful luck with it, so I decided to venture out and buy another when my Toro lawn mower seized up out of the blue. I really like this mower: fuel efficiency, features, value, etc.<br>However there are a few things worth noting about overall quality vs. my dad's 2011 model of this mower. Improvements: <br>Cutting height- My dad's mower cannot cut at very tall heights; thankfully two extra cutting heights have made this mower more practical for me.<br>Ease of transport- My dad's mower required you to unscrew two plastic pieces on both sides of the handle bars to fold them down. It is a very slow process, and can be quite a pain. This mower now has two pieces that pop out and twist to the side allowing you to fold the handle bars in one second flat.<br>Mowing options- While this mower still cannot side discharge, changing from mulching to bagging is now a breeze. A single switch on the deck allows you to change from mulching to bagging without having to remove a mulching attachment. The bad:<br>Since the price-point of this mower has changed relatively little over the past 6-7 years, Honda has had to cut quality to meet inflation. This is very apparent when you are starting the mower. The Auto Choke system has changed, and takes 2-3 pulls to start (versus one pull for the 2011 model). Honda has also made the bag thinner, which allows small pieces of grass to fly out of it, and turns it a dusty-brown when some become trapped within. The wheels have below average grip, so it will occasionally struggle going up steep hills. The plastic back flap also bends and warps over a short period of time, not visually appealing, but it does not hurt the performance of the mower. While there are some negatives to the overall performance and value of this mower, it's easy enough to overlook those, and I expect to get many years of service out of this mower.","I am a teen who own my own lawn service, so I have had to venture out and buy various types of la...",Bob,HD

When you add this lawnmower to your shopping cart, Home Depot (even Amazon) will also suggest that you purchase a 100 feet 16-gauge extension cord in order to use this lawnmower if you do not yet have one. You should not buy the suggested 16-gauge extension cord just to use this lawnmower.
The manual, even the manufacture's website, said that you should use a 14-gauge extension cord instead. Why, using the 16-gauge extension cord may cause this lawnmower to under perform at lawn mowing and may cause the motor to overheat, which is an $100 investment you may not want to risk.","Use a 14-gauge extension cord instead!
