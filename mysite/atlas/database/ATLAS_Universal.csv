What makes this mower extraordinary is it's auto choke easy start engine, intuitive easy to use drive system and it's light weight maneuverability. But the best feature is it's twin cutting blades.

"," The mower made it's maiden voyage today, and performed flawlessly. Assembled easily in minutes, and cranked on the first pull. My bermuda lawn gets scalped once early each year, so I set the mower to its lowest setting. Adding to the challenge is the fact that my lawn is covered with last years leaves. I started in bag mode, but quickly re-evaluated after filling the bag with leaves in one pass. Switching to mulch mode, countless trips to empty the bag were avoided. My old mower is a Honda, so I expected quality performance. Still, I was pleasantly surprised at the results in mulch mode. Granted, I needed double passes on occasion to completely mulch the leaves, but double passes were much quicker than continually dumping the bag, and the motor never stalled.  I was skeptical about the variable speed control, especially after reading the 1* reviews. Once again, pleasantly surprised! It took some experimentation to get the adjustable paddles in a desirable position, which for me was rather low, so that no matter how far I depressed them, the speed never got very high. Many with poor reviews cited speed control and thumb fatigue as issues. My instinct was to lay my thumbs on the paddles too, but Honda's promo video shows that the proper grip has the pad of the thumb knuckle laying on the paddles, with thumbs either above, or wrapped under the grip. In this manner, rolling the wrist slightly toggles the mechanism, rather than using thumb leverage. (Honda's promo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5ikBT_DOkE ). It was easy to control acceleration and no hand cramps at all. Mower started cold, started hot and the transition of the auto choke was undetectable. A flawless performance today, and I expect years of the same. Pros: easy start, flawless auto choke, no stalls, good mulch quality<br>Cons: bag is a bit smaller than the previous model. Could be problematic with very high/thick grass, but shouldn't be a problem for once-a-week mowers. I recommend mulch mode for high grass.","The mower made it's maiden voyage today, and performed flawlessly.

"," I am a teen who own my own lawn service, so I have had to venture out and buy various types of lawn equipment. In doing so, I have discovered many things about all the big name brands and their quality. My dad owns the 2011 model of this mower, and has had wonderful luck with it, so I decided to venture out and buy another when my Toro lawn mower seized up out of the blue. I really like this mower: fuel efficiency, features, value, etc.<br>However there are a few things worth noting about overall quality vs. my dad's 2011 model of this mower. Improvements: <br>Cutting height- My dad's mower cannot cut at very tall heights; thankfully two extra cutting heights have made this mower more practical for me.<br>Ease of transport- My dad's mower required you to unscrew two plastic pieces on both sides of the handle bars to fold them down. It is a very slow process, and can be quite a pain. This mower now has two pieces that pop out and twist to the side allowing you to fold the handle bars in one second flat.<br>Mowing options- While this mower still cannot side discharge, changing from mulching to bagging is now a breeze. A single switch on the deck allows you to change from mulching to bagging without having to remove a mulching attachment. The bad:<br>Since the price-point of this mower has changed relatively little over the past 6-7 years, Honda has had to cut quality to meet inflation. This is very apparent when you are starting the mower. The Auto Choke system has changed, and takes 2-3 pulls to start (versus one pull for the 2011 model). Honda has also made the bag thinner, which allows small pieces of grass to fly out of it, and turns it a dusty-brown when some become trapped within. The wheels have below average grip, so it will occasionally struggle going up steep hills. The plastic back flap also bends and warps over a short period of time, not visually appealing, but it does not hurt the performance of the mower. While there are some negatives to the overall performance and value of this mower, it's easy enough to overlook those, and I expect to get many years of service out of this mower.","I am a teen who own my own lawn service, so I have had to venture out and buy various types of la...",http://www.homedepot.com/p/Honda-Honda-21-in-3-in-1-Variable-Speed-Gas-Self-Propelled-Mower-with-Auto-Choke-HRR216K9VKA/203709643,Bob,HD

"," I've read many reviews about this mower. I bought it and after one summer it wouldn't start. I changed the air filter and spark plug but still nothing. I use regular unleaded gas that uses ethanol. Biggest problem for small engines is ethanol because it will clog up the carburetor. I watched a YouTube video on how to clean this model lawnmower carburetor. I'm not exactly mechanically inclined but I followed it step by step. It's really easy to clean one. I spent $4 on carb/choke cleaner and when I put it back together the lawnmower started up on the first pull. It runs great. If you can get ethanol free gas, buy it.

"," We read all the reviews and bought this mower anyway. It's always a hit or miss with anything right? I trust no reviews where the person has only had the products a month or two. So, after less than a year, bought in summer 2016, now it's verging on spring 2017 and the mower doesn't start. Read more reviews after changing the spark plug and it still didn't start. So, now we're out buying carb/choke cleaner to clean the carburetor after we watch a you.tube video to learn how to do it. It seems like a lot of work for something that we haven't even owned a year yet. My last mower lasted 15 years with me only adding gas, oil and cleaning the filter. Don't think I even changed the spark plug on that thing....ever. So, if you don't mind putting in mechanical time into this thing before you've even owned it a year, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, it's a piece of junk but then I guess all these newer motors are since none of them can handle the new gasoline that we're forced to buy. You'd think if the gas changes and they modify our car/truck engines to adapt, that they would catch on when making lawn mower engines. No, apparently not. We still don't know if it will start working again, so as of right now, it doesn't start....less than a year. So, for review guideline purposes, what features stand out most? the one where it doesn't work! What do I like/dislike about it? dislike that it doesn't work!

","Well owned a J6200 from a year ago and decided to buy 3 more J6200 to finish a plan and 2 of the 3 had bad LCD screens. Send both back and where I bought them they sent 2 65 inch J6200's in place of the 2 bad 60 inch TV's. Of course I had to pay for them. The 1st 65 inch came in and wouldn't power up so had to replace that one. So finally after 6 TV's, 2 bad LCD's and 1 that didn't power up I finally got my 3 TV's after allot of hassle, time and aggravation..

You can flash drive music,movies and photos with this port....no one broadcasts or makes much input for us to use 4 K on anyway....yet...found the guide for over the air broadcast, on this tv to be of little use.but the TV GUIDE app has everything...It is on the I pad...VIZIO also has apps....  I have figured out how to cast the I pad and I phone to the big screen on you tube, and that is very very handy...<br> This tv found the router in just a minute...and after you set your zip code and time zone bingo your watching on the Internet or live streaming broadcast, or if your hooked up cable tv... Seems the blue ray picture is supposed to be the best but I am very pleased with over air HDTV and the antenna...<br> I have a VIZIO sound bar but it does NOT fit between the set's legs.... It must have room in front of them, or under them even better...

After the first 2-3 weeks I probably would have given this 5 stars, I was amazed at the value of this sub $400 1080p TV. Admittedly the picture on this TV is pretty darn good, we use this in our bedroom and I prefer it's picture over the 55"" Samsung in our living room. I was excited to have Roku built into the TV, as we have it mounted and I wanted to minimize cords. As a happy user of two other Roku devices I understand how they work and use them daily. Unfortunately the ROKU is the downfall of this TV, the software & apps are buggy it's not just one specific app- it seems to vary based on software upgrades. At first the SLING TV app would constantly freeze then after a month that resolved itself, then Netflix wouldn't connect unless you connected first with another app (SLING, AMAZON, etc). Some apps require you to repeatedly sign-in, others just simply don't work. Currently, regardless of app, the TV just freezes for one to two minutes. Again, I use these same apps on other Roku devices on the same wifi network with absolutely no problems. I have called customer service and the solution is always the same, delete the app - reset the unit - redownload the app. If I had to only do this very infrequently, it wouldn't be a problem but its now part of the routine. Other issues I've experienced, we have a local over-air channel 4, the TV is very confused by this, constantly thinking channel 4 should be used for accessing another device. I've tried multiple settings and can get it to work, but then the system resets itself and I have to go through the rigamarole again. I probably wouldn't buy this TV again, although the price is great - it would be worth my piece of mind to buy a reliable TV with a separate Roku device. It's cheap, but not a good value.

It's essentially no longer a smart tv since it will rarely connect to my ISP and when it does, it's super slow and only for a very short amount of time. So it can really only be used for local tv (we specifically got rid of satellite and switched to the smart TV and paid for Amazon Prime to save money yearly). So, while I did love the tv, it was great in the beginning...it's pretty much just a dumb tv now since no one can figure out what has happened (other than it has nothing to do with my ISP) or how to fix it. So i'm left with a TV that does nothing that I purchased it for and having to eventually (because there is no way I can afford it at the moment) shell out more money for another TV that, if i'm lucky, will actually work.

"," This hot plate seems very well built and the ceramic burner seems to maintain an even temperature as the heating element cycles on and off. The two knob operation is different from most, with the left for on/off and the right for temperature selection. The temperature selection offers enough range for almost any cooking requirement from very low to high. Even at its highest setting the burner does not become red and was much hotter than I thought during the first use (I burned what I was cooking). This unit will boil 4 cups of water in 5-6 minutes in a 8"" pot, which fits perfectly on the ceramic burner. That's much faster than I expected. I would strongly recommend an 8"" diameter pot or kettle to take full advantage of the larger burner size on this unit. Be aware that the metal housing does get very hot during use and takes considerable time to cool down.

",I purchased this phone from Home Depot because I wanted to replace my old AT&T Trimline phone which I had it for over 20 years and it is still in working condition except the ringer bell tone does not work. I was searching for this type of phone through various web sites and the prices were anywhere from $17.00 to $23.00 and Home Depot had the cheapest price for around $12.99. This phone works excellent. The only disadvantage is the electronic ringer tone is not loud and my old AT&T Trim line phone that I had for over 20- years had a very loud ringing bell tone.

","Very impressed with the unit. We've have been using the unit for about a month now. Delivery was quick and packaging was well done to protect the unit during shipping. Installation was easy. We live in an old house built in the 1880's with copper pipes. . My water here is hard so we have a water softener. I also have an inline water filter that connects to my kitchen sink that helped with water taste prior to purchasing this unit. I used a charcoal filter in it to improve my water taste. I removed the charcoal water filter and installed a paper filter so not to restrict my water pressure to the RO system. Took me a couple of hours to install the RO unit. I mounted the unit in my basebent crawl area, with access from my basement. I have about 5 ft of clearance that allowed me to mount it underneath the floor area below the kitchen sink. I built a plywood mount with a platform on the opposite side for the tank to sit on. I bought an ice maker kit to connect to my refrigerator ice maker and made all the connections at one time. This made my wife very happy....no more filling ice trays. Had one minor leak at a quick connection but pushed the hose in tighter and had no leaks from then on. We are very impressed with the water taste. Our water total dissolved solid reading is 349 in our regular sink water. Through the RO unit it is 21. Very impressed overall. We have been using bottled water for our coffee maker. I tested that water and had a 0 to 7 reading. My wife commented that there is no longer any particles in her water after the ice melts inside her water glass. You would usually see small mineral particles at the bottom of the glass. Always assumed it was minerals but not sure. The taste of our water is so much better now. We love the unit and recommended it to my brother who lives in Arizona. He was complaining about the price of his bottled water delivery service increasing for his home use. He said it would pay for itself in 6 months verses his bottled water costs. Overall we love the great tasting water this produces. The water pressure from the tank is very good. We use it for our coffee maker, drinking and our ice maker. I discovered my wife was using reg sink water for cooking the other day. She said she didn't think to use it for cooking. She said she would be using it for cooking from now on. All in all we are very satisfied with the water taste and knowing we are drinking safe water now. Living in farm country in northern Illinois there's a good chance there could be chemicals leaching into our water supply. We highly recommend it to everyone.",Very impressed with the unit.
